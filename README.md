**Dev Tasks** is open source project and completely free to use.

However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without
proper financial backing. You can support Dev Tasks development via the following methods:

## Overview
The aim of creating Dev Tasks is to help developers to organize their daily tasks. As a developer, I needed an application
to take notes, create code snippets and follow my pull requests in a single application.

Dev Tasks allows you to create tasks, take notes with a very rich [editor](https://editorjs.io/) and assign your pull requests to the task.

## Development
